The sender uses generic placeholders like '[Competitor]' and '[Company]' which suggests this isn't truly personalized research. More importantly, there's no mention of proven track record, customer references, or support quality - all critical factors for me. The request for a 20-minute chat without offering a pilot program or committee-friendly evaluation process doesn't align with my consensus-driven approach. The P.S. about the panel discussion feels fabricated given the generic nature of the rest of the email."
