I noticed on LinkedIn that you're scaling rapidly, and with 80 people now, I can imagine the manual HR processes are becoming quite challenging.\n\nHaving worked with several post-Series B companies like Datastack and TechFlow, we've seen how overwhelming it can be to manage employee onboarding and compliance across multiple systems while maintaining the personal touch that CloudFirst is known for.\n\nFlowAI has helped similar HR leaders reduce their manual workload by 60% through intelligent automation. For instance, we helped FastGrowth (another data analytics company) streamline their entire employee onboarding process from 12 hours to just 2 hours per new hire.\n\nWould you be open to a quick video call next week to explore how we could help CloudFirst maintain its great employee experience while automating the heavy lifting?\n\nBest,\n[Name]",
