Their team was spending 35-40% of time on manual deployments and customer onboarding – we reduced that to 8% through intelligent workflow automation.\n\nThe key was automating the CI/CD pipeline handoffs and customer provisioning sequences using our API-first platform. It integrates directly with GitHub, Jenkins, and Kubernetes (which I noticed you're using based on your tech stack).\n\nWe recently helped a 200-person fintech reduce deployment cycles from 2 days to 4 hours while maintaining SOC 2 compliance. I've put together a 5-minute technical demo video specifically showing these deployment automations.\n\nWould you be interested in taking a look?
