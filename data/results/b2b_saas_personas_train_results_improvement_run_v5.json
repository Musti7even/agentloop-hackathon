          "message": "Hi Sarah,\n\nI noticed your recent LinkedIn post about scaling operations challenges at [Company]. Having worked with similar-sized fintech startups, the manual data entry and cross-system coordination pain points you mentioned resonated.\n\nOne fintech client (50-person team, similar to yours) reduced customer onboarding time by 65% by automating data validation and system updates across Salesforce, Stripe, and internal tools. Their ops team now saves 22 hours/week through AI-powered workflow automation.\n\nI'd love to share their detailed case study and show you how we're helping ops teams eliminate manual work through intelligent process automation. Would you have 15 minutes this week to discuss how we could help streamline your onboarding workflow specifically?\n\nI can demonstrate exactly how we'd automate your current manual processes, with projected time savings based on your team size.\n\nBest,\n[Name]\n\nP.S. Here's a 2-minute video showing the automated onboarding workflow in action: [Link]",
