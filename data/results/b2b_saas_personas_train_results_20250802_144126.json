Having worked with several fintech startups, I understand the headaches of managing customer onboarding across multiple systems.\n\nOur AI workflow platform has helped operations teams like yours reduce manual data entry by 60% on average. For context, a similar-sized fintech, Plaid, automated their customer onboarding process and now saves 25 hours per week per ops specialist.\n\nWould you be open to a 20-minute call next week? I'd like to share specific workflows we've built for fintech operations teams, along with ROI data from companies matching your scale. You can pick a time here: [Calendar Link]\n\nBest,\n[Name]\n\nP.S. Saw you attended SaaStr last month - we should compare notes on the latest ops automation sessions!",
