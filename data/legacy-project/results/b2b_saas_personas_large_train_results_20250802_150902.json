Your recent campaign for EcoLife was brilliant!\n\nAs a founder juggling client work and agency growth, I imagine automated reporting and project management aren't exactly where you want to spend your energy. Many agency leaders we work with were spending 15+ hours weekly on these manual tasks before switching to FlowAI.\n\nWould you be open to a quick video chat next week? I'd love to show you how other boutique agencies are using our platform to automate their client reporting and project workflows - typically saving 20+ hours per team member monthly. Our customers particularly love how it integrates with their existing tools while keeping everything visual and intuitive.\n\nHow does Tuesday at 11am EST work for a 20-minute call?\n\nBest,\n[Name]",
