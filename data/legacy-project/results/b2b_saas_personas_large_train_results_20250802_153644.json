FlowAI's platform was specifically designed for regulated industries, with HIPAA compliance and SOC 2 Type II certification built into our automation framework.\n\nOur healthcare clients typically reduce manual compliance reporting by 65% while maintaining complete audit trails. Boston MedTech recently automated their approval workflows using our platform, cutting processing time from 3 days to 4 hours while strengthening their compliance protocols.\n\nWould you be open to a brief discussion about how we're helping medical device companies streamline operations without compromising security or compliance?\n\nBest regards,\n[Name]",
