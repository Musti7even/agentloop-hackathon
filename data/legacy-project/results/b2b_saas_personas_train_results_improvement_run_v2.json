FlowAI's API-first platform integrates directly with your existing stack (saw you're using Jenkins and Kubernetes) and automates compliance documentation.\n\nOur technical docs (I can share access) detail our REST API, WebHooks, and HIPAA-compliant microservices architecture. We also offer pre-built integrations for common healthcare tech workflows.\n\nWould you be open to a 15-min technical discussion? Happy to share our API documentation and architecture diagrams beforehand.\n\nBest,\n[Your name]\n\nP.S.

The 15-minute ask feels premature without demonstrating clear ROI potential or providing the promised case study first.
